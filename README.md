# Carousel feature

This project is based on building a **carousel feature** as a web application contains three images on a frame and three indicator buttons. We're going to discuss about this project in details with the following topics outlining steps taken to achieving the above feature.

1. Planning.
2. Building.
3. Debugging.

## Planning

This is the first stage in this very project cycle. Here I try to make research about that aforementioned feature. During my research I tried to see various online web application with the same feature as what am trying to work on.

Therefore with this I was able to see different project that has similar feature in part or full functionality with the project feature that I will be working on.

Moreover, after visiting different web application with similar functionality. I started the process of planning how to implement different major parts of carousel functionality I have broken down. For instance

1. How to stack different images together.
2. How to automatically display different images one after another.
3. How to display different images on the click of buttons **left** and **right** to show the correct image.
4. How to implement indicator button.
5. How to display the progress of the carousel feature using different buttons.
6. How to implement change of image by clicking the indicator button.

## Building

After planning and understanding various components and materials necessary to accomplish carousel feature functionality.

A wireframe was generated during planning process to guide the building process. This was made possible with the use of online web application **Figma**.

The functionality listed above in the planning process was successfully implemented in this stage during the carousel image feature.

Furthermore, some feature that deemed important was equally implemented during the development process. For instance disabling the **Left** or **Right** direction button when it's the first or last picture in the slide.

Finally, during the development process various mistake, error and bugs was encountered but was fixed thanks to debugging process. This will be discussed in the next paragraph.

## Debugging

It's expected to encounter challenges during a development process in a developer's life. But, with help of debugging process these challenges was tackled or eliminated. With the help of tools like google chrome and microsoft visual code editor (vscode) was pretty helpful during this process.

Finally, the duck method was introduced at some point to better understand exactly what each part of the code was actually doing or supposed to be doing.
